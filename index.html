            My project focused on implementing a simulation-rendering pipeline for novel motion synthesis
            that supports image style transfer. Specifically, I aimed to extend the method introduced in
            “PhysGaussian: Physics-Integrated 3D Gaussians for Generative Dynamics” [Xie, et. al. 2024] by
            introducing the 3D image style transfer technique outlined in “StyleGaussian: Instant 3D Style
            Transfer with Gaussian Splatting” [Liu, et. al. 2024].

          <p>
            I began the project by using the StyleGaussian codebase
            to train the NeRF synthetic ficus model provided by PhysGaussian project.
            I also walked through its rendering pipeline to understand what
            information is loaded, and how StyleGaussian uses the artistic model and
            a style image to compute new colors for the scene.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, what happens is the following:

          <p>
            An extension of the original 3D Gaussian Splatting method, StyleGaussian takes
            a set of reconstructed 3D Gaussians and embeds VGG features into these 3D Gaussians.
            With a given style image, the features of the embedded Gaussians are transformed using
            the style information. The transformed features are then decoded into RGB, giving us
            the final stylized 3D Gaussians.

        <!-- <h3 class="title is-4">Simulation and Rendering (PhysGaussian)</h3> -->
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Then, switching over to the PhysGaussian technique, I worked on adapting the
            simulation-rendering pipeline to accommodate the style transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forking the original PhysGaussian repository, I modified it so that it uses
            the StyleGaussian codebase as a submodule instead of the original Gaussian
            Splatting codebase, so that PhysGaussian could use StyleGaussian's methods
            of restoring and retrieving color information from the artistically-trained
            model.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the program that runs the simulation, I extended the Gaussian model
            loading stage. Instead of loading solely the reconstructed 3D Gaussian model,
            the program also loads the artistically-trained Gaussian model if allowed,
            which the program derives the updated color informaiton from.
          </p>
          <p>
            What happens then is, when we run the updated gs-simulation.py, the program
            reads arguments from the command line, which includes a model path and an
            optional style image path. If a style image path is detected, then the program
            loads the reconstruction and artistic models. Using the artistic model and the
            style image, we compute the overriding color to be used during the rendering
            process. If this overriding color exists, then we render the scene with the
            overriding color, instead of computing the spherical harmonics.

          <h3 class="title is-4">Challenges</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              There were several challenges all throughout this project. When considering how
              to host this project within the initial setup, I ran into quite a few
              hardware-related troubles which set me back a couple weeks in my development of the project.
              Both the PhysGaussian and StyleGaussian projects depend on the original reference
              implementation of "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering," which
              heavily relies on CUDA and is not macOS-friendly. I tried using my instructional account,
              but the requirements of the repository demanded a lot of disk space which my instructional account
              could not support. Instead, I pivoted to working on the project primarily in Google CoLaboratory,
              which has its limitations. At the start of the project, I was working with CoLab’s A100 GPU
              but had to swap to its T4 GPU because of resource limits. Moreover, there were a few instances
              where I would get disconnected, in which case my runtime would get deleted and I lost some process.
              Later, I ran out of compute units on CoLab, so I pivoted away from CoLab and started working on
              Gradient Notebooks by Paperspace, which saves all changes within my notebook, even after disconnects.
              Towards the end of the project and after the project demo, however, I started getting CUDA errors
              that I was unable to resolve in time, so I couldn’t achieve other desirable results, such as style
              training additional models, including full-scene ones.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Moving forward</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Because of time and hardware constraints, I wasn't able to achieve all the tasks I wanted to
              in this project, which include:
              <ul>
                <li>Training and testing additional white-background models</li>
                <li>Rendering and simulating scenes with complete backgrounds</li>
              </ul>
              In the future, I hope to improve on the codebase so that I may achieve these areas, as well as
              provide pre-trained models on this site so that others can attempt replicating and extending on
              the pipeline in other innovative ways. Furthermore, it seems that within the deep learning process,
              both memory and computation costs increase with the number of Gaussians. I'd like to do explore
              adjacent literature to understand other methods of style transfer that can save considerable memory,
              as it relates to some of the CUDA issues I encountered in my final stages of this project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3 class="title is-4">Reflections</h3>
          <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>
              Reflecting on my experience, I realize I greatly underestimated the time it would
              take, as well as the amount of resources, I'd need to implement this project. Given my lack of
              experience in computer vision and deep learning, I wasn't able to properly gauge the workload
              upon pursuing thisproject. Even with the provided codebases, I still found some of the implementation
              difficult to understand. Nonetheless, this experience allowed me to learn a lot in a short amount of
              time! While I'm still a little shaky in these areas, I feel better acquainted with topics in computer
              vision, which is a goal that I had going into this project. I've also never worked with machine learning
              prior to this, so while the progress was grueling and my results are somewhat minimal, I'm very satisfied
              with what I <em>was</em> able to output.
            </p>
            <p>
              I chose to pursue this project because I find the idea of style transfer to be really exciting! I've always
              found shading and texturing to be one of the coolest aspects of computer graphics and the 3D art pipeline, so
              exploring a way to essentially quick-shade a real life environment with existing art then animate it was
              really fascinating. I really enjoyed the open-endedness of deep-diving into a new paper and project in the
              computer graphics and computer vision space, and getting the chance to build on top of it!
