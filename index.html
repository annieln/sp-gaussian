            I set out to implementing style transfer into physics-integrated 3D Gaussians for generative dynamics, which is an extension of the PhysGaussian method originally introduced here. This was my first attempt working with computer vision and deep learning, so it was a pretty challenging but insightful experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach augments neural radiance fields
            (NeRF) by optimizing an
            additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a
            canonical 5D NeRF.
            We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and
            propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for
            more robust optimization.
            By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like
            models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further
            improves robustness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We show that <span class="dnerf">Nerfies</span> can turn casually captured selfie
            photos/videos into deformable NeRF
            models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary
            viewpoints, which we dub <i>"nerfies"</i>. We evaluate our method by collecting data
            using a
            rig with two mobile phones that take time-synchronized photos, yielding train/validation
            images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully
            reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high
            fidelity.

              There were several challenges all throughout this project. When considering how
              to host this project within the initial setup, I ran into quite a few
              hardware-related troubles which set me back a couple weeks in my development of the project.
              Both the PhysGaussian and StyleGaussian projects depend on the original reference
              implementation of "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering," which
              heavily relies on CUDA and is not macOS-friendly. I tried using my instructional account,
              but the requirements of the repository demanded a lot of disk space which my instructional account
              could not support. Instead, I pivoted to working on the project primarily in Google CoLaboratory,
              which has its limitations. At the start of the project, I was working with CoLabâ€™s A100 GPU
              but had to swap to its T4 GPU because of resource limits. Moreover, there were a few instances
              where I would get disconnected, in which case my runtime would get deleted and I lost some process.
              Later, I ran out of compute units on CoLab, so I pivoted away from CoLab and started working on
              Gradient Notebooks by Paperspace, which saves all changes within my notebook, even after disconnects.
              Towards the end of the project and after the project demo, however, I started getting CUDA errors
              that I was unable to resolve in time, so I couldnâ€™t achieve other desirable results, such as style
              training additional models, including full-scene ones.
